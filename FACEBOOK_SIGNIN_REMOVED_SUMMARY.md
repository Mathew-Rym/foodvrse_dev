# ✅ Facebook Sign-In Option Completely Removed!

## 🎯 Issue Identified

### **Problem:**
The user reported that the Facebook sign-in option was still present in the authentication page, despite previous requests to remove it. The button was showing "Continue with Facebook" and needed to be completely removed.
