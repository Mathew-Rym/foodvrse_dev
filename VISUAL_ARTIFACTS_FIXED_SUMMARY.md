# ✅ Visual Artifacts (Arrow Characters) Fixed!

## 🎯 Issue Identified

### **Problem:**
The user reported seeing unwanted visual elements on the pages - specifically arrow-like characters (`--> --> -->`) appearing in the bottom-left portion of white areas on the pages. These were described as "this white section with -> from the top and bottom of the pages."

### **Visual Description:**
- White background with a solid, dark green horizontal bar across the top
- Arrow-like characters (`--> --> -->`) appearing in the bottom-left portion of the white area
- These elements were distracting and not intended to be part of the UI

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **CSS Fixes Added:**

#### **1. Hidden Scrollbars:**
```css
* {
  scrollbar-width: none;
  -ms-overflow-style: none;
}

*::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}
```

#### **2. Removed Pseudo-elements:**
```css
body::before,
body::after,
html::before,
html::after {
  content: none !important;
  display: none !important;
}
```

### **Purpose:**
These CSS rules ensure that:
- No scrollbars are visible (which can sometimes create visual artifacts)
