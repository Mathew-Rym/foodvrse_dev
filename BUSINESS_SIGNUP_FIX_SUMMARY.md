# ✅ Business Signup Fix Summary

## 🎯 Issue Fixed
The business signup page was showing "Sign Up" instead of "Apply to Partner" and was allowing businesses to self-register instead of redirecting them to the partner application page.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Business Auth Button Text Change
**File**: `src/pages/Auth.tsx`

**Changed button text and action**:
- **Before**: "Sign Up" button that toggled between sign-in and sign-up
- **After**: "Apply to Partner" button that redirects to `/partner-application`

```typescript
// Before
<button onClick={() => setIsSignUp(!isSignUp)}>
  {isSignUp ? 'Sign In' : 'Sign Up'}
</button>

// After
<button onClick={() => isSignUp ? setIsSignUp(false) : navigate('/partner-application')}>
  {isSignUp ? 'Sign In' : 'Apply to Partner'}
</button>
```

### ✅ 2. Business Registration Flow
**Updated business authentication flow**:
- **Sign In**: Works normally for existing business accounts
- **Apply to Partner**: Redirects to partner application page instead of allowing self-registration
- **Consumer Flow**: Unchanged - consumers can still sign up normally

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### ✅ Before Fix:
- ❌ Business signup showed "Sign Up" button
